posmaster
=========

A basic framework in Django for a EVE Online POS Management System

State
-----

This project was originally started to replace some of the aging POS management tools that Test Alliance Please Ignore were using. Just as the core was starting to take shape CCP announced that some big fuel changes were coming in, so the project was placed on the backburner until the new release. Since then its hung around in a private repository not doing much at all.

If someone has a use for this code, then you're more than welcome to it.
